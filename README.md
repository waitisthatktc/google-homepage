This is a project to deconstruct and rebuild the Google homepage using what I've learned so far on The Odin Project.

Aug 18, 2020: Beginning the project
Aug 20, 2020: Got the main elements onto the page(header, footer, google img, search form, and buttons)
Need to figure out how to get my content elements to line up and set their individual height/width/margin/padding/etc
Need to find the correct color for footer and sign-in buttons
Need to find how to size up the buttons correctly to resemble search form on Google
Added index.html, style.css and searchresults.html(the later two being empty at the current moment)
Aug 24, 2020: Got most of the header elements mostly lined up
Got the Google image, search form, and buttons aligned in the center of the page
Got the footer links and background color inserted in their proper spots

Still need to finish:
Getting the sign-in button to have rounded corners and be aligned with the rest of the header text instead of the top of the button
Getting the correct color on the search form's header
Getting the correct background color for the header
Changing the footer's font size

Aug 27, 2020: The search box and icon have been added, rounded the sign-in button, changed font size for the footer

Things that I have slightly broken from trying to fix it:
The header is now misaligned where if I set the display inline and add a margin, the right side shifts without the left side

Still need to finish: 
Getting the correct color of the search form buttons
Getting the correct color on the search form's header
Getting the correct background color for the header
