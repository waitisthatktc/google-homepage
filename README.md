This is a project to deconstruct and rebuild the Google homepage using what I've learned so far on The Odin Project.

Aug 18, 2020: Beginning the project
Aug 20, 2020: Got the main elements onto the page(header, footer, google img, search form, and buttons)
Need to figure out how to get my content elements to line up and set their individual height/width/margin/padding/etc
Need to find the correct color for footer and sign-in buttons
Need to find how to size up the buttons correctly to resemble search form on Google
Added index.html, style.css and searchresults.html(the later two being empty at the current moment)
